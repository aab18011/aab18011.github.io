I’m a multidisciplinary scientist and junior researcher working at the interface of **Computational Chemistry**, **Computational Biology**, and **Transition‑Metal Complex Catalysis**. My goal is to deepen our understanding of molecular structure and reactivity, and to translate that knowledge into new, greener technologies. I am also keenly interesting in cognitive sciences as it relates to molecular physics.
