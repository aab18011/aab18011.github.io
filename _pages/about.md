# About Me

I’m a multidisciplinary scientist and junior researcher working at the interface of **Computational Chemistry**, **Computational Biology**, and **Transition‑Metal Complex Catalysis**. My goal is to deepen our understanding of molecular structure and reactivity, and to translate that knowledge into new, greener technologies.
